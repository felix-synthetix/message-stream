# Message-Stream.ai - Project Context

## Project Goal
Message-Stream.ai is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a message prioritization system. The primary goal is to aggregate communications from various channels (email, chat, socials, etc.) into a single, unified interface. This system will help users cut through the noise and focus on what matters most by organizing and prioritizing messages according to user-defined themes, priorities, or projects.

## Core Functionality
- **Communication Aggregation:** Combine messages from multiple sources like email, instant messaging, and social media into one feed.
- **Decisioning Engine:** Implement an intelligent engine to categorize, organize, and prioritize the aggregated messages.
- **User-Defined Priorities:** Allow users to input their current focus areas (themes, priorities, projects) to guide the decisioning engine.

## Initial Setup
The project is bootstrapped as a vanilla Nest.js application. The immediate objective is to have a simple Node.js application running with a basic health check API endpoint.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Nest.js (Node.js)
- **Package Manager:** npm
